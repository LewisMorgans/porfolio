                        Written in TypeScript using the Angular 6 framework, my team and I developed a streamlined and
                        scalable solution to allow customers to access quotations in a far more time-efficient manner.
                        By implementing core foundations to the project such as being able to search by property
                        postcode, and auto-populating the required information for a quote such as roof type or distance
                        to the nearest water source, we were able to reduce the customer's journey time dramatically -
                        increasing customer retention and sales exponentially. </p>

                        My team was created with the sole purpose of completely rewriting the Admiral quotation engine.
                        The objective was to bring Admiral in line with current technology by removing an outdated
                        Angular.js framework and implementing Angular 8, making use of many technologies such as NGRX
                        state management and the RXJS library (allowing us to program reactively leveraging observables
                        to compose asynchronous and callback code). This, in line with Java-based APIs on a Maven
                        middle-tier, meant we were able to deliver a significantly faster, more powerful, adaptable and
                        scalable solution to serve Admiral products for years to come. Implementing this new engine
                        reduced loading times, error reports and increased customer retention. This was a large project
                        that took several hundreds of hours to complete. To do this we needed to streamline our work
                        process, involving for example removing the native Angular testbed and creating custom unit
                        tests running in 3.5 seconds as opposed to 15 minutes. Heavy planning, use of current software
                        paradigms and following the development lifecycle enabled us to deliver a highly functioning
                        product in little time.
