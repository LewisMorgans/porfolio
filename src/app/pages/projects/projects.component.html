                    and I developed a streamlined and scalable solution to allow customers to access quotations in a far
                    more time-efficient manner. By implementing core foundations to the project such as being able to
                    search by property postcode, and auto-populating the required information for a quote such as roof
                    type or distance to the nearest water source, we were able to reduce the customer's journey time
                    dramatically - increasing customer retention and sales exponentially. </p>

                    My team was created with the sole purpose of completely rewriting the Admiral quotation engine.
                    The objective was to bring Admiral in line with current technology by removing an outdated
                    Angular.js framework and implementing Angular 8, making use of many technologies such as NGRX
                    state management and the RXJS library (allowing us to program reactively leveraging observables
                    to compose asynchronous and callback code). This, in line with Java-based APIs on a Maven
                    middle-tier, meant we were able to deliver a significantly faster, more powerful, adaptable and
                    scalable solution to serve Admiral products for years to come. Implementing this new engine
                    reduced loading times, error reports and increased customer retention. This was a large project
                    that took several hundreds of hours to complete. To do this we needed to streamline our work
                    process, involving for example removing the native Angular testbed and creating custom unit
                    tests running in 3.5 seconds as opposed to 15 minutes. Heavy planning, use of current software
                    paradigms and following the development lifecycle enabled us to deliver a highly functioning
                    product in little time. </p>
