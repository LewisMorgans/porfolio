          Hi, I'm Lewis, <br><strong>Software Engineer.</strong><br><br>
          
           I have over 4 years experience in software development, working along side some of the best UX/UI designers, QA testers, Engineers and Product Owners South Wales has to offer.
          Whilst growing my knowledge professionally I have also developed several projects for small businesses, music groups to continue my own development.<br><br>
          In excess of technical ability, I also have excellent soft skills, such as communication with stake holders, leading team meetings, problem solving and coaching my peers. 
          My focus within the industry is web application based. I have been working with JavaScript with a heavy focus on Object Oriented TypeScript since the beginning of my career. 
          Leveraging the Angular 2 framework and node packages to produce high quality, scalable solutions.<br><br>
          
           Outside of my day job, I am also a freelancer. I continue to work with other engineers and businesses in my spare time offering them the same levels of quality and commitment as I do
          my current employer. I am used to working in an agile enviroment, with precice project management, delivering quality code at fair financial costs.
