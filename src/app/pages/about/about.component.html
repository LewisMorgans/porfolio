          <p>Hi, Take a look around!</p>
        </span><br><br>

        I have over 4 years experience in software development, working alongside some of the best UX/UI designers, QA
        testers, Engineers and Product Owners South Wales has to offer. Whilst working in permamnent employment I also remain contracting on the side,
        developing several projects for the likes of small business owners, local bands and more.<br><br>
        In excess of my technical ability, I also have excellent soft skills, such as communication with stakeholders,
        leading AGILE ceramonies, problem solving and coaching my peers. My focus within the industry is in web
        applications. I have been working within JavaScript, with a heavy focus on
        Object Oriented TypeScript since the beginning of my career. And continue to leverage the Angular 2 framework and NPM library to produce high quality, scalable solutions.<br><br>

        Over the course of my career I have developed understanding in several frameworks, both front end and back end, to allow myself to become a fullstack engineer.
        I am capable of completing server side work in Node.js and Next.Js with Express. Java with Maven and Interacting with Databases and front end Model View Controllers. 
        I am used to working in an Agile enviroment, with precice project management, delivering high quality engineering solutions, meeting scoped deadlines without compromising quality or secuirty.
